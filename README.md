Welcome to AnkiExam – Smarter Learning, Better Retention

Thank you for choosing AnkiExam. Our goal is simple: to help you learn more efficiently and retain information longer by transforming the way you review.

Traditional long review sessions often lead to mental fatigue, reduced focus, and overconfidence. It becomes harder to accurately judge what you truly know versus what you only think you know. AnkiExam solves this problem by integrating advanced AI tools directly into your study process, giving you an interactive, adaptive, and personalized learning experience.

With AnkiExam, you can:

Turn passive review into active assessment
Let your AI examiner challenge you in real time. Get instant feedback on your answers and an accurate assessment of your understanding—no guessing, no blind spots.

Generate smarter, targeted questions
Use your existing decks and let AnkiExam create additional, customized questions designed to fill knowledge gaps and deepen comprehension—without adding extra work.

Leverage your own study materials
Upload slides, textbook chapters, or notes directly into AnkiExam. The AI will extract key concepts and transform them into high-quality, exam-style questions tailored to your content.

Practice long-answer and critical-thinking questions
Go beyond flashcards. Generate open-ended, essay-style questions and have the AI evaluate your responses, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.

Personalize your learning experience
Whether you’re preparing for standardized exams, medical school, law school, or personal projects, AnkiExam adapts to your pace and goals, ensuring that every review session is productive and focused.

By integrating intelligent question generation and AI-driven assessment into your Anki workflow, AnkiExam turns your decks into a powerful, interactive learning system. Spend less time wondering what to study and more time mastering it.

AnkiExam is currently in open-beta. User demand will be assessed, and server limits appropriately improved, given significant traffic.

The open-beta model is currently only supporting free-models from the host: together-ai. Subsequent versions will include faster, and more accurate models at limited cost.

AnkiExam is commited to staying free, but server upkeep requires financing.
